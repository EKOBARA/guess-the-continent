## Project Discription

I am going to buid a geography trivia game. You will be promped a question and expected to give an input. The gave will go on for a set amount of questions and then will output your total score and a list of the questions and their correct responces letting the user know which ones they answered correctly.

The questions would be formated where the player is given a country name and is then prompted to give the continent that said country is located on.
